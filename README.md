# MyFirstRepo
Terrible Software for No One
Hi, this is my first repo. I am quite confused, but I suppose I am starting to understand. 

It seems to me that a repo is just a sort of project. The project consists of different version. We can all share and delight in them. When you want a specific version you "pull" it. When you change a version, you can commit it to the main branch, or create a new branch. I guess I get it?
